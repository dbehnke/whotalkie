```

### Key Components

#### 1. **CLI Streaming Tool** (`cmd/whotalkie-stream/main.go`)
- **Purpose**: Publish-only client for external audio sources
- **Input**: Ogg Opus from stdin (FFmpeg output)
- **Features**: Real-time statistics, configurable parameters, graceful shutdown, progressive retry logic (10s, 30s, 1m)
- **Usage**: `ffmpeg -i input -c:a libopus -f opus - | whotalkie-stream`
- **Reliability**: Auto-reconnects on server failures with backoff strategy

#### 2. **Ogg Opus Parser** 
- **Critical Innovation**: Parses Ogg container format to extract raw Opus packets
- **Frame Extraction**: Uses segment table to get complete 70-113 byte Opus frames
- **Compatibility**: Bridges FFmpeg Ogg output with WebCodecs decoder requirements

#### 3. **Enhanced Web Interface** (`web/templates/dashboard.html`, `web/static/dashboard.js`)
- **Channel Grid**: Responsive grid layout showing all active channels with real-time states
- **Click-to-Join**: Direct channel joining via clicking channel cards
- **Activity Indicators**: Visual feedback for talking states (green highlighting, animated borders)
- **Always-On Stats**: Persistent audio transmission/reception statistics with bitrate monitoring
- **Smart Styling**: Readable text on all backgrounds, consistent channel ordering
- **NaN Protection**: Robust bitrate calculations with last-valid-value fallback

#### 4. **WebCodecs Integration**
- **Encoder**: 48kHz, 32kbps, mono Opus encoding for microphone input
- **Decoder**: Native browser Opus decoding with proper timing
- **Buffering**: Smart 3-frame buffer system for smooth streaming

#### 5. **Server Enhancements** (`cmd/server/main.go`, `internal/state/manager.go`, `internal/types/types.go`)
- **Publish-Only Mode**: Dedicated support for streaming clients with corrected PTT blocking logic
- **Audio Relay**: Efficient binary packet forwarding
- **Channel Management**: Fixed user data updates and consistent sorting for UI stability
- **Speaker Tracking**: Enhanced SpeakerState with timestamps and user information
- **Graceful Shutdown**: SIGINT/SIGTERM handling

## üîß Technical Specifications

### Audio Format
- **Codec**: Opus (standardized across entire system)
- **Sample Rate**: 48kHz
- **Bitrate**: 32kbps
- **Channels**: Mono
- **Frame Size**: 70-113 bytes per Opus packet

### Network Protocol
1. **WebSocket Connection**: JSON metadata + binary audio data
2. **Audio Metadata**: JSON message with format, chunk size, timestamp
3. **Binary Data**: Raw Opus packets immediately following metadata

### Performance Metrics
- **Latency**: ~20ms encoding/decoding overhead
- **Bandwidth**: ~32 KB/s per active stream
- **Buffer Strategy**: 3-frame (60ms) build-up for smooth playback

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Live Radio Streaming
```bash
ffmpeg -v quiet -i https://stream.zeno.fm/vgchxkqc998uv \
  -c:a libopus -b:a 32k -ac 1 -application audio -ar 48000 -vn -f opus pipe:1 | \
  ./whotalkie-stream -channel "wtrs" -alias "WTRS"
```

### File Streaming
```bash
ffmpeg -i audio.mp3 -c:a libopus -b:a 32k -f opus - | \
  ./whotalkie-stream -channel "music" -alias "DJ Bot"
```

### Microphone Streaming
```bash
ffmpeg -f avfoundation -i ":0" -c:a libopus -b:a 32k -f opus - | \
  ./whotalkie-stream -channel "live" -alias "Live Mic"
```

## üêõ Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. **Opus WebAssembly Library 404**
- **Problem**: External opus-wasm library no longer available
- **Solution**: Migrated to native WebCodecs API for browser Opus support

### 2. **Audio Format Mismatch**
- **Problem**: FFmpeg outputs Ogg Opus container, WebCodecs expects raw frames
- **Solution**: Implemented complete Ogg parser using segment table extraction

### 3. **WebCodecs Decoder Errors**
- **Problem**: "Required member is undefined" in EncodedAudioChunk constructor
- **Solution**: Added required `type: 'key'` property and proper timestamp handling

### 4. **Audio Stuttering and Dropouts**
- **Problem**: Immediate playback causing timing issues
- **Solution**: Implemented smart buffering with 3-frame build-up and continuous processing

## üìä Real-Time Statistics System

### Features
- **Live Bitrate Monitoring**: Current transmission/reception rates
- **Byte Counters**: Transmitted and received data tracking  
- **Duration Tracking**: Real-time transmission duration
- **Visual Effects**: Fade-in/out animations for smooth UI updates
- **100ms Refresh Rate**: High-frequency updates for responsive feedback

### Implementation
```javascript
// Statistics update every 100ms
setInterval(updateAudioStats, 100);

// Bitrate calculation
audioStats.currentTransmitBitrate = audioStats.transmissionDuration > 0 ? 
  (audioStats.transmittedBytes * 8 / audioStats.transmissionDuration / 1000) : 0;
```

## üîÑ Smart Audio Buffering System

### Algorithm
1. **Frame Queuing**: Incoming Opus frames added to buffer array
2. **Build-up Logic**: Wait for 3+ frames before starting playback
3. **Continuous Processing**: Process frames with proper timing intervals
4. **Timing Synchronization**: Use nextPlayTime for smooth scheduling

### Benefits
- **Eliminates Dropouts**: Network jitter compensation
- **Smooth Streaming**: Consistent audio flow
- **Adaptive**: Automatically adjusts to incoming data patterns

- [ ] **Production security** (rate limiting, input validation, CORS policies)

## Server build policy

- The server codebase MUST remain pure Go (no cgo) to preserve simple cross-compilation and production buildability. Any heavy-weight container demuxing that requires native libraries (libogg/libopus) should be implemented in client streamers (publish-only clients) or provided as optional, out-of-tree tooling.
- Clients/publishers are free to use cgo (libogg/libopus) locally to perform demuxing and then send raw Opus frames + JSON metadata to the server.

**Current Status**: Enhanced system ready for production deployment phase üöÄ

## üîå Reconnection & Resume (unexpected disconnects)

If a client is disconnected unexpectedly, clients should automatically attempt to re-establish their session and resume where possible. Add the following guidance to client implementations and operations runbooks.

Client recommendations
- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s...) up to a ceiling (30s). Keep retry attempts idempotent.
- On reconnect, send a `hello` event that includes the previous `user_id` (if available), alias/username, and the channel the client was in. Example below.
- After a successful hello, rejoin the previous channel (either via the `hello` extras or a subsequent `channel_join` event) and restore UI state (selected channel, PTT button state).
- Publish-only clients should resume publishing by re-sending audio metadata and continuing the stream; use a small pre-roll buffer if desired to avoid gaps.
- If the client wants to take over an existing stale connection, include a `takeover` flag in the hello so the server can close the prior connection and re-associate state.

Server expectations
- The server should accept reconnection attempts that present the same `user_id` and re-associate state when no conflict exists.
- If a prior connection appears active, the server may accept a takeover request (explicit `takeover` in `hello`) and close the old connection before associating the new one.
- Treat re-joins as ordinary join events for UI and analytics (broadcast `user_join` as appropriate).

Sample reconnect hello payload
```json
{
  "type": "hello",
  "user_id": "previous-user-id",
  "alias": "MyName",
  "channel": "previous-channel",
  "takeover": true
}
```

Troubleshooting
- If clients repeatedly fail to reconnect, verify proxy/load-balancer timeouts (handshake/idle timeouts) and server `ReadHeaderTimeout` and ping/pong settings.
- Correlate disconnect and reconnect attempts using server logs (CID and `user_id`).
- Consider adding explicit server-side diagnostics (per-connection last-seen timestamps, last ping/pong) if recurring disconnects persist.
